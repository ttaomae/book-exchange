#Book Exchange
This is a Play application which provides a textbook exchange for a local community (e.g. students of a University, rather than random online users).

##Data Model
In this application each student can make many requests and offers. Similarly, each book can be associated with many requests and offers. However, each request or offer is associated with only one student and one book.
