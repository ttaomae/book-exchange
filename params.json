This application is intended to be used within a relatively small, local community, such as students of a single university or even a single department in a university. By limiting the users to a local community, finding books should be quicker and more convenient than alternatives such as Amazon and more reliable than sites like Craigslist.\r\n\r\nMy current vision of the final application is briefly shown and described in [this blog post](toddtaomae.wordpress.com/2013/04/26/a-break-from-play/). However, the current version of the application has not reached that point yet. The application currently supports adding, editing, and removing books, students, offers, and requests. One very important missing feature is an actual user system. Without that, the application will never be more than a mockup. \r\n\r\n##User Interface\r\n###Create Pages\r\nHere are the pages to create new entities to add to the database. I've omitted the page to create an offer as it is very similar to the one to create a request.\r\n\r\n![Book Exchange Create Book](https://raw.github.com/ttaomae/book-exchange/gh-pages/images/create_book.png)\r\n\r\n![Book Exchange Create Student](https://raw.github.com/ttaomae/book-exchange/gh-pages/images/create_student.png)\r\n\r\n![Book Exchange Create Request](https://raw.github.com/ttaomae/book-exchange/gh-pages/images/create_request.png)\r\n\r\n###List Pages\r\nHere are the pages that list all of the available books, students and requests. Again, I've omitted the page for offers.\r\nNotice that in the book list, there is an 'X' in the column for offers and an 'O' in the column for requests. This indicates that there are requests available for that particular book. \r\n\r\n![Book Exchange Book List](https://raw.github.com/ttaomae/book-exchange/gh-pages/images/available_books.png)\r\n\r\n![Book Exchange Request List](https://raw.github.com/ttaomae/book-exchange/gh-pages/images/available_requests.png)\r\n\r\n![Book Exchange Student List](https://raw.github.com/ttaomae/book-exchange/gh-pages/images/students.png)\r\n\r\n###Edit Pages\r\nIn each of the above screenshots, any of the blue links would lead to a page to edit the appropriate item. I have omitted these pages, since they are nearly identical to the ones to create a new entity.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
